# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**TomD101/TomD101** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

## Here's a little about me:
- ðŸ”­ I recently developed new skills by completing a bootcamp in ***Data Science*** run by **HyperionDev**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been learning how to code in **Python**, how to utilise **PyTorch**, and other fundamentals in Machine Learning and Algorithms required for ***Data Science*** and ***Materials Informatics***.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects using my new skills once I've a solid foundation.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with discoveing what avenues my career might take, which will ideally utilise my **Materials Science background** with these new **coding and data science** skills.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my career as the first employee at **Sugru**, and how we brought a concept 'wonder material' for modifying and repairing everyday items into being, to be used millions of times worldswide!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you stretch an uninflated baloon, then quickly return it to its original length, then feel the temperature against your face - it will feel cold as energy is absorbed in the process of elastic recovery!!
