# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**TomD101/TomD101** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

##Here's a little about me:##
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills towards completing a **University of Nottingham** accredited bootcamp in ***Data Science*** run by **HyperionDev**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in **Python** and the fundamentals in math and linear algebra required for ***Data Science***.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects using my new skills once I've a solid foundation. In particular I will be seeking to participate in ***hackathons*** to gain experience.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with discoveing what avenues my career might take, which will ideally utilise my **Materials Science background** with these new **coding and data science** skills.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my career as the first employee at **Sugru**, and how we brought a concept 'wonder material' for modifying and repairing everyday items into being, to be used millions of times worldswide!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you stretch an uninflated baloon, then quickly return it to its original length, then feel the temperature against your face - it will feel cold as energy is absorbed in the process of elastic recovery!!
